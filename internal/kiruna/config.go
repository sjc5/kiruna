	OnChangeCallbacks []OnChange

	// Use this if your onChange saves a file that will trigger another reload process,
	// or if you need this behavior for any other reason. Will not reload the browser.
	// Note that if you use this setting, you should not set an explicit strategy on
	// the OnChange callbacks (or set them explicitly to "pre"). If you set them to
	// "post" or "concurrent" while using RunOnChangeOnly, the OnChange callbacks will
	// not run.

	// showing in the browser)

	RecompileBinary bool

	// Use this if you explicitly need the app to be restarted before reloading the browser.
	// Example: You might need this if you memory cache template files on first hit, in which
	// case you would want to restart the app to clear the cache.
	RestartApp bool

	// This may come into play if you have a .go file that is totally independent from you
	// app, such as a wasm file that you are building with a separate build process and serving
	// from your app. If you set this to true, processing on any captured .go file will be as
	// though it were an arbitrary non-Go file extension. Only relevant for Go files -- for
	// non-Go files, this is a no-op.
	TreatAsNonGo bool

	// If set to true, everything will behave the same, except that instead of doing a hard reload
	// of the browser window via `window.location.reload()`, Kiruna will instead run a method called
	// `__kirunaRevalidate` (if it exists on the window object). This can be useful, for example,
	// if you are running an external build process with enough intelligence to know how to inject
	// newly built route-level CSS without hard-reloading the page. For example, your framework might
	// provide you with a client-side revalidate function, in which case you'd set
	// `window.__kirunaRevalidate` to that function, and set this field to true.
